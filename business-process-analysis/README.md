# Business Process Analysis

This section presents business process diagrams derived from
my analysis of operational workflows in a manufacturing environment.

The processes are mapped to reflect my understanding of how
end-to-end business activities are executed across multiple functions,
supported by an ERP system.

All diagrams are created for portfolio and demonstration purposes.
