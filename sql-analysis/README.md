## How I Approach SQL Analysis

My SQL work typically follows this flow:

1. Understand the business question or user request  
2. Identify relevant business entities and data sources  
3. Design table relationships and joins  
4. Apply aggregation and calculation logic  
5. Validate results from a business perspective

## Example Use Cases

- Operational data checking
- Ad hoc data extraction based on user requests
- Sales target vs achievement analysis (by sales representative, by territory, etc)
- Annual purchased material weight analysis(by supplier, by material group, etc) to support ESG data requirement

## Notes

- The database schema and sample data are designed for portfolio purposes  
- Table and column names are kept close to real-world ERP structures
