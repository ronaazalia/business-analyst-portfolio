### TL;DR

This section demonstrates how a previously unstructured change handling process was transformed into a standardized, SDLC-aligned change management framework.
The improvement introduced clear governance, documentation, testing, and sign-off stages to reduce rework, improve traceability, and support scalable IT delivery.

---
### Background & Vision

The long-term vision was to implement structured project management practices across the organization. Due to the complexity of a full-scale rollout,
the improvement was implemented incrementally, starting with change management as a more manageable scope.
Since both project management and change management follow the same SDLC framework, the process is presented as a single consolidated flow,
as the underlying principles and stages are aligned.

The team adopted a Waterfall approach rather than Agile due to the organization’s current level of process maturity. 
Establishing a clear and structured framework was prioritized, with Waterfall serving as the initial foundation before progressing toward more iterative methodologies.

### Why This Matters

Before this improvement, change requests were handled informally, relying heavily on individual communication and undocumented approvals.
This created risks such as unclear requirements, inconsistent testing, limited traceability, and frequent rework during development and deployment.

By standardizing the change management process, the organization gained clearer control over requirement validation, testing, and deployment decisions,
while ensuring changes could be tracked end-to-end from request initiation to production rollout.

## Before vs After Summary

**🔴Before (As-Is)**
1. Change requests could bypass formal ticketing and documentation
2. No standardized requirement validation or BRD sign-off
3. Testing and acceptance were informal and inconsistent
4. Limited traceability from request to deployment
5. High dependency on individual PICs

**🟢After (To-Be)**

1. All changes start with a formal change request ticket
2. Structured requirement elicitation and BRD approval
3. Defined testing flow including UAT and sign-off
4. End-to-end traceability across the SDLC
5. Scalable, repeatable process independent of individuals

### My Role & Contribution
1. Designed the end-to-end change management process with Project Manager
2. Mapped the As-Is and To-Be workflows
3. Defined governance points and responsibilities
4. Created supporting documentation such as BRDs and UAT scripts, mentored the existing team and newly hired team to adapt with the new workflow
5. Coordinated with users, developers, and stakeholders during implementation
